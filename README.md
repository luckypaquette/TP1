   Initiation to Programming Logic
   Introduction to programming logic : without prior knowledge of JavaScript.
   We are limited to certain Javascript commands. Moreover, we cannot
   use any mathematical functions (math()) or any preprogrammed fucntions 
   (ie: palindrome). These must be created by the programmer with custom 
   variables and code.
